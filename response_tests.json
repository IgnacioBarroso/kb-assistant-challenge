Trinity races to\nScene description: the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto\nScene description: the fire escape.\nScene description: Trinity steps out of Neo's room to find Cypher watching\nScene description: her.\nCYPHER: I don't remember you ever bringing\nCYPHER: me dinner.\nScene description: Trinity says nothing.\nCYPHER: There's something about him, isn't\nCYPHER: there?\nTRINITY: Don't tell me you're a believer\nTRINITY: now?\nScene description: 53.\nCYPHER: I just keep wondering if Morpheus\nCYPHER: is so sure, why doesn't he take\nCYPHER: him to the Oracle?  She would\nCYPHER: know.\nTRINITY: Morpheus will take him when he's\nTRINITY: ready.\nScene description: She turns and he watches her walk away.\nScene description: The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.\nScene description: 58.\nScene description: The long dark hall beckons.  Neo follows Morpheus out of\nScene description: the elevator and the DOORS RATTLE shut behind him.  With\nScene description: every step, a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in\nScene description: around him.\nScene description: At the end of the hall, Morpheus steps to the side of a\nScene description: door.\nMORPHEUS: I told you that I can only show\nMORPHEUS: you the door.  You have to step\nMORPHEUS: through it.\nScene description: Neo blows out a breath.  His hand reaches but stops,\nScene description: hovering over the spherical handle.  He backs away.\nNEO: Morpheus, I don't think this is a\nNEO: good idea.\nMORPHEUS: Why?\nNEO: I told you I don't believe in this\nNEO: stuff.  No matter what she says\nNEO: I'm not going to believe it, so\nNEO: what's the point?\nScene description: 68.\nMORPHEUS: What do you believe in?\nNEO: What do I believe in?  Are you\nNEO: kidding me?  What do you think?\nNEO: The world I grew up in isn't real.\nNEO: My entire life was a lie.  I don't\nNEO: believe in anything anymore.\nMORPHEUS: That's why we're here.\nNEO: Why?  So I can hear some old lady\nNEO: tell me, what?  That I'm this guy\nNEO: that everybody's been waiting for?\nNEO: That I'm supposed to save the\nNEO: world?  It sounds insane.\nNEO: Unbelievable.  And I don't care\nNEO: who says it, it's still going to\nNEO: sound insane and unbelievable.\nMORPHEUS: Faith is not a matter of\nMORPHEUS: reasonability.  I do not believe\nMORPHEUS: things with my mind.  I believe\nMORPHEUS: them with my heart.  In my gut.\nNEO: And you believe I'm the One?\nMORPHEUS: Yes I do.\nNEO: Yeah?  What about the other five\nNEO: guys?  The five before me?  What\nNEO: about them?\nScene description: Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his\nScene description: chest.\nNEO: Did you believe in them too?\nMORPHEUS: I believed what the Oracle told\nMORPHEUS: me... no, I misunderstood what she\nMORPHEUS: told me.  I believed that it was\nMORPHEUS: all about me.\nScene description: This is difficult for Morpheus to admit.\nScene description: 69.\nMORPHEUS: I believed that all I had to do\nMORPHEUS: was point my finger and anoint\nMORPHEUS: whoever I chose.  I was wrong,\nMORPHEUS: Neo.  Terribly wrong.  Not a day\nMORPHEUS: or night passes that I do not\nMORPHEUS: think of them.  After the fifth, I\nMORPHEUS: lost my way.  I doubted everything\nMORPHEUS: the Oracle had said.  I doubted\nMORPHEUS: myself.\nScene description: He looks up at Neo.\nMORPHEUS: And then I saw you, Neo, and my\nMORPHEUS: world changed.  You can call it\nMORPHEUS: an epiphany, you can call it\nMORPHEUS: whatever the hell you want.\nMORPHEUS: It doesn't matter.  It's not\nMORPHEUS: about a word.  It's about this.\nMORPHEUS: So I can't explain it to you.\nMORPHEUS: All I can do is believe, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: believe that one day you will\nMORPHEUS: feel what I felt and know what\nMORPHEUS: I know; you are the sixth and\nMORPHEUS: the last.  You are the One.\nScene description: His eyes blaze.\nMORPHEUS: Until that time all I am asking\nMORPHEUS: from you is for you to hold on to\nMORPHEUS: whatever respect you may have for\nMORPHEUS: me and trust me.\nScene description: Neo feels a rush from Morpheus's intensity, the\nScene description: unadulterated confidence of a zealot.\nNEO: All right.\nScene description: He reaches for the handle which turns without him even\nScene description: touching it.  A WOMAN wearing white opens the door.\nPRIESTESS: Hello, Neo.  You're right on time.\nScene description: Agent Smith screams, his calm machine-like expression\nScene description: shredding with pure rage.\nScene description: He rushes Neo.  His attack is ferocious but Neo blocks\nScene description: each blow easily.  Then with one quick strike to the\nScene description: chest he sends Agent Smith flying backwards.\nScene description: For the first time since their inception, the Agents know\nScene description: fear.\nScene description: Agent Smith gets up, bracing himself as Neo charges him\nScene description: and springs into a dive.  But the impact doesn't come.\nScene description: Neo sinks into Agent Smith, disappearing, his tie and coat\nScene description: rippling as if he were a deep pool of water.\nScene description: Spinning around he looks to the others and feels\nScene description: something, like a tremor before a quake, something deep,\nScene description: something that is going to change everything.\nScene description: Suddenly a SEARING SOUND stabs through his earpiece as\nScene description: his chest begins to swell, then balloon as/nobreakspace--\nScene description: Neo BURSTS up out of him.  And with a final death scream,\nScene description: Agent Smith EXPLODES like an empty husk in a brilliant\nScene description: cacophony of light, his shards spinning away, absorbed by\nScene description: the Matrix until/nobreakspace--\nScene description: Only Neo is left.\nScene description: Neo faces the remaining Agents.  They look at each other,\nScene description: the same idea striking simultaneously/nobreakspace--\nScene description: They run.\nScene description: 124.\nScene description: Again he hears her.  He reacts to the RINGING PHONE,\nScene description: rushing toward it even as/nobreakspace--",

He turns and his\nScene description: smile lights up the room.  A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes\nScene description: the old building.\nMORPHEUS: At last.\nScene description: He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible\nScene description: behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and\nScene description: they shake hands.\nMORPHEUS: Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt\nMORPHEUS: have guessed, I am Morpheus.\nNEO: It's an honor.\nMORPHEUS: No, the honor is mine.  Please.\nMORPHEUS: Come.  Sit.\nScene description: He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an\nScene description: adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in\nScene description: cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.\nMORPHEUS: I imagine, right now, you must be\nMORPHEUS: feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\nMORPHEUS: down the rabbit hole?\nNEO: You could say that.\nMORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes.  You\nMORPHEUS: have the look of a man who accepts\nMORPHEUS: what he sees because he is\nMORPHEUS: expecting to wake up.\nScene description: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.\nScene description: 28.\nMORPHEUS: Ironically, this is not far from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  But I'm getting ahead\nMORPHEUS: of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: why are you here?\nNEO: You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.\nNEO: Most hackers would die to meet\nNEO: you.\nMORPHEUS: Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we\nMORPHEUS: both know there's more to it than\nMORPHEUS: that.  Do you believe in fate,\nMORPHEUS: Neo?\nNEO: No.\nMORPHEUS: Why not?\nNEO: Because I don't like the idea that\nNEO: I'm not in control of my life.\nMORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean.\nScene description: Again, that smile that could cut glass.\nMORPHEUS: Let me tell you why you are here.\nMORPHEUS: You have come because you know\nMORPHEUS: something.  What you know you\nMORPHEUS: can't explain but you feel it.\nMORPHEUS: You've felt it your whole life,\nMORPHEUS: felt that something is wrong with\nMORPHEUS: the world.  You don't know what,\nMORPHEUS: but it's there like a splinter in\nMORPHEUS: your mind, driving you mad.  It is\nMORPHEUS: this feeling that brought you to\nMORPHEUS: me.  Do you know what I'm talking\nMORPHEUS: about?\nNEO: The Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: Do you want to know what it is?\nScene description: Neo swallows hard and nods.\nScene description: 29.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is everywhere, it's all\nMORPHEUS: around us, here even in this room.\nMORPHEUS: You can see it out your window or\nMORPHEUS: on your television.  You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.  Like\nMORPHEUS: everyone else, you were born into\nMORPHEUS: bondage, kept inside a prison that\nMORPHEUS: you cannot smell, taste, or touch.\nMORPHEUS: A prison for your mind.\nScene description: The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.\nMORPHEUS: Unfortunately, no one can be told\nMORPHEUS: what the Matrix is.  You have to\nMORPHEUS: see it for yourself.\nScene description: Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.\nScene description: In the left, a blue pill.\nMORPHEUS: This is your last chance.  After\nMORPHEUS: this, there is no going back.  You\nMORPHEUS: take the blue pill and the story\nMORPHEUS: ends.  You wake in your bed and\nMORPHEUS: you believe whatever you want to\nMORPHEUS: believe.\nScene description: The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.\nMORPHEUS: You take the red pill and you stay\nMORPHEUS: in Wonderland and I show you how\nMORPHEUS: deep the rabbit-hole goes.\nScene description: Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture\nScene description: growing in his palms.\nMORPHEUS: Remember that all I am offering is\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  Nothing more.\nScene description: Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The\nScene description: Cheshire smile returns.\nMORPHEUS: Follow me.",

It is dangerous.\nMORPHEUS: They have trouble letting go.\nMORPHEUS: Their mind turns against them.\nMORPHEUS: I've seen it happen.  I'm sorry.\nMORPHEUS: I broke the rule because I had to.\nScene description: He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to\nScene description: himself as to Neo.\nMORPHEUS: When the Matrix was first built\nMORPHEUS: there was a man born inside that\nMORPHEUS: had the ability to change what he\nMORPHEUS: wanted, to remake the Matrix as he\nMORPHEUS: saw fit.  It was this man that\nMORPHEUS: freed the first of us and taught\nMORPHEUS: us the truth; as long as the\nMORPHEUS: Matrix exists, the human race will\nMORPHEUS: never be free.\nScene description: He pauses.\nScene description: 44.\nMORPHEUS: When he died, the Oracle\nMORPHEUS: prophesied his return and\nMORPHEUS: envisioned that his coming would\nMORPHEUS: hail the destruction of the\nMORPHEUS: Matrix, an end to the war and\nMORPHEUS: freedom for our people.  That is\nMORPHEUS: why there are those of us that\nMORPHEUS: have spent our entire lives\nMORPHEUS: searching the Matrix, looking for\nMORPHEUS: him.\nScene description: Neo can feel his eyes on him.\nMORPHEUS: I did what I did because I believe\nMORPHEUS: the search is over.\nScene description: He stands up.\nMORPHEUS: Get some rest.  You're going to\nMORPHEUS: need it.\nNEO: For what?\nMORPHEUS: Your training.\nScene description: Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The\nScene description: door opens and TANK steps inside.\nTANK: Morning.  Did you sleep?\nNEO: No.\nTANK: You will tonight.  I guarantee it.\nTANK: I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.\nScene description: He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.

However, it does contain metaphoric descriptions of humans being grown and used as resources by the Machines, such as in the scenes set in the Fetus Fields and the Power Plant, where humans are depicted as fields of crops or being liquefied and fed intravenously. These images imply that humans are like resources exploited by a system or machinery, which can be metaphorically likened to a virus that spreads or parasitizes its host. The analogy of humans to a virus is not directly quoted or explicitly stated, but the imagery aligns with the idea of humans as a resource or a form of life that is exploited for the system's purposes.",

For our\nTRINITY: protection.\nNEO: From what?\nTRINITY: From you.\nScene description: She lifts a strange steel and glass device that looks\nScene description: like a cross between a rib separator, speculum and air\nScene description: compressor.\nSWITCH: Take off your shirt.\nScene description: He looks at the strange device and the gun still trained\nScene description: on him.\nNEO: What?  Why?\nSWITCH: Stop the car.\nScene description: Apoc does.\nSWITCH: Listen to me, coppertop!  We don't\nSWITCH: have time for 'twenty questions.'\nSWITCH: Right now there is only one rule.\nSWITCH: Our way or the highway.\nNEO: Fine.\nScene description: Neo opens the door.\nTRINITY: Neo, please, you have to trust me.\nNEO: Why?\nTRINITY: Because you've been down there,\nTRINITY: Neo.  You already know that road.\nTRINITY: You know exactly where it ends.\nScene description: Neo stares out into the sheets of rain railing against\nScene description: the dark street beyond the open door.\nTRINITY: And I know that's not where you\nTRINITY: want to be.\nScene description: He closes the door.\nScene description: Neo grudgingly strips off his T-shirt.\nTRINITY: Lie back.\nScene description: Trinity aims the device at Neo, its glass snout forming a\nScene description: seal over his navel.  Switch snaps a cable into the front\nScene description: seat cigarette lighter.\nNEO: What is this thing?\nTRINITY: We think you're bugged.  Try to\nTRINITY: relax.\nScene description: She turns a dial and the machine bears down on Neo's\nScene description: midsection, the cylinder sucking hard at his stomach.\nScene description: Neo screams, squinting in pain as Trinity watches the\nScene description: needle on a pressure gauge climb steadily.\nTRINITY: Come on, come on...\nScene description: On a small monitor that projects an ultrasound-like\nScene description: image, we see Neo's insides begin to slither and churn.\nScene description: He gasps as something wiggles beneath his skin inside his\nScene description: stomach.\nSWITCH: It's on the move.\nTRINITY: Shit.\nSWITCH: You're gonna lose it.\nTRINITY: No I'm not.  Clear.\nScene description: The foreboding word hangs in Neo's ear for a moment when\nScene description: Trinity squeezes a trigger.  Electric current hammers\nScene description: into Neo and rigid convulsions take hold of him beneath\nScene description: the flickering car lamp until --\nScene description: Something finally rockets wetly out of Neo's stomach\nScene description: through the extractor's coils.\nNEO: Jesus Christ!  It's real?!\nNEO: That thing is real?!\nScene description: Trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing.\nScene description: Inside, the small fluke-like bug flips and squirms, its\nScene description: tendrils flapping against the clear walls.\nScene description: She unrolls the window and dumps it out.\nScene description: Neo sits beside Trinity in the back.  He cannot stop\nScene description: staring as the simple images of the urban street blur\nScene description: past his window like an endless stream of data rushing\nScene description: down a computer screen.\nMORPHEUS: Almost unbelievable, isn't it?\nScene description: Neo nods as the car continues to wind through the crowded\nScene description: city.\nScene description: 65.\nNEO: God...\nTRINITY: What?\nNEO: I used to eat there... Really good\nNEO: noodles...\nScene description: He is speaking in a whisper, almost as if talking to\nScene description: himself.\nNEO: I have these memories, from my\nNEO: entire life but... none of them\nNEO: really happened.\nScene description: He turns to her.\nNEO: What does that mean?\nTRINITY: That the Matrix cannot tell you\nTRINITY: who you are.\nNEO: But an Oracle can.\nTRINITY: That's different.\nNEO: Obviously.\nScene description: He turns to the window for a moment and then turns back.\nNEO: Did you go to her?\nTRINITY: Yes.\nNEO: What did she tell you?\nTRINITY: She told me...\nScene description: She looks at him and suddenly she is unable to speak or\nScene description: even breathe.\nScene description: 66.\nNEO: What?\nScene description: The car suddenly jerks to a stop.\nMORPHEUS: We're here.  Neo, come with me.\nScene description: Neo and Morpheus get out of the car.  Cypher looks into\nScene description: the rearview mirror at Trinity.\nCYPHER: Here we go again, eh, Trin?\nScene description: He smiles as she turns to the window.\nScene description: Neo and Morpheus get in the car.\nMORPHEUS: Let's go.\nScene description: Cypher looks into the rearview mirror at Neo.\nCYPHER: Well, good news or bad news?\nMORPHEUS: Not now, Cypher.\nScene description: Cypher slaps the car in gear and pulls into traffic.\nScene description: Trinity looks at Neo who is staring at the final bit of\nScene description: cookie.  He puts it in his mouth and chews.\nTRINITY: Are you all right?\nNEO: ... Right as rain.",

CITY STREET - TRAINING PROGRAM - DAY\nScene description: Morpheus moves effortlessly through a crowded downtown\nScene description: street while Neo struggles to keep up, constantly bumped\nScene description: and shouldered off the path.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is a system, Neo, and\nMORPHEUS: that system is our enemy.  But\nMORPHEUS: when you are inside and you look\nMORPHEUS: around, what do you see;\nMORPHEUS: businessmen, lawyers, teachers,\nMORPHEUS: carpenters.  The minds of the very\nMORPHEUS: people we are trying to save.  But\nMORPHEUS: until we do, these people are\nMORPHEUS: still a part of the system and\nMORPHEUS: that makes them our enemy.\nScene description: A cop writing a parking ticket stares at Neo from behind\nScene description: his sunglasses.\nMORPHEUS: You have to understand that most\nMORPHEUS: of these people are not ready to\nMORPHEUS: be unplugged and many of them are\nMORPHEUS: so inured, so hopelessly dependent\nMORPHEUS: on the system that they will fight\nMORPHEUS: to protect it.\nScene description: A beautiful woman in a red dress smiles at Neo as she\nScene description: passes by.\nMORPHEUS: Were you listening to me, Neo?  Or\nMORPHEUS: were you looking at the woman in\nMORPHEUS: the red dress?\nNEO: I was...\nScene description: 54.\nMORPHEUS: Look again.\nScene description: Neo turns just as Agent Smith levels a gun at his face.\nScene description: Neo screams.\nMORPHEUS: Freeze it.\nScene description: Everything except Morpheus and Neo freezes.\nNEO: This -- this isn't the Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: No, it's another training program\nMORPHEUS: designed to teach you one thing;\nMORPHEUS: if you are not one of us, you're\nMORPHEUS: one of them.\nNEO: What are they?\nMORPHEUS: Sentient programs.  They can move\nMORPHEUS: in and out of any software still\nMORPHEUS: hardwired to their system.  That\nMORPHEUS: means that anyone that we haven't\nMORPHEUS: unplugged is potentially an Agent.\nMORPHEUS: Inside the Matrix, they are\nMORPHEUS: everyone and they are no one.\nScene description: Neo stares at the Agent.\nMORPHEUS: We've survived by hiding from\nMORPHEUS: them, running from them, but they\nMORPHEUS: are the gatekeepers, they're\nMORPHEUS: guarding all the doors, holding\nMORPHEUS: all the keys, which means that\nMORPHEUS: sooner or later someone is going\nMORPHEUS: to have to fight them.\nNEO: Someone?\nMORPHEUS: I won't lie to you, Neo.  Every\nMORPHEUS: single man or woman who has stood\nMORPHEUS: their ground, who has fought an\nMORPHEUS: Agent, has died.  But where they\nMORPHEUS: failed, you will succeed.\nNEO: Why?\nMORPHEUS: I've seen an Agent punch through a\nMORPHEUS: concrete wall.  Men have emptied\nMORPHEUS: entire clips at them and hit\nMORPHEUS: nothing but air.  Yet their\nMORPHEUS: strength and their speed are still\nMORPHEUS: based on a world that is built by\nMORPHEUS: rules.  Because of that they will\nMORPHEUS: never be as strong or as fast as\nMORPHEUS: you can be.\nScene description: Neo scratches his head.\nNEO: What?  Are you trying to tell me\nNEO: that I can dodge bullets?\nMORPHEUS: No, Neo.

He turns and his\nScene description: smile lights up the room.  A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes\nScene description: the old building.\nMORPHEUS: At last.\nScene description: He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible\nScene description: behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and\nScene description: they shake hands.\nMORPHEUS: Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt\nMORPHEUS: have guessed, I am Morpheus.\nNEO: It's an honor.\nMORPHEUS: No, the honor is mine.  Please.\nMORPHEUS: Come.  Sit.\nScene description: He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an\nScene description: adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in\nScene description: cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.\nMORPHEUS: I imagine, right now, you must be\nMORPHEUS: feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\nMORPHEUS: down the rabbit hole?\nNEO: You could say that.\nMORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes.  You\nMORPHEUS: have the look of a man who accepts\nMORPHEUS: what he sees because he is\nMORPHEUS: expecting to wake up.\nScene description: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.\nScene description: 28.\nMORPHEUS: Ironically, this is not far from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  But I'm getting ahead\nMORPHEUS: of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: why are you here?\nNEO: You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.\nNEO: Most hackers would die to meet\nNEO: you.\nMORPHEUS: Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we\nMORPHEUS: both know there's more to it than\nMORPHEUS: that.  Do you believe in fate,\nMORPHEUS: Neo?\nNEO: No.\nMORPHEUS: Why not?\nNEO: Because I don't like the idea that\nNEO: I'm not in control of my life.\nMORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean.\nScene description: Again, that smile that could cut glass.\nMORPHEUS: Let me tell you why you are here.\nMORPHEUS: You have come because you know\nMORPHEUS: something.  What you know you\nMORPHEUS: can't explain but you feel it.\nMORPHEUS: You've felt it your whole life,\nMORPHEUS: felt that something is wrong with\nMORPHEUS: the world.  You don't know what,\nMORPHEUS: but it's there like a splinter in\nMORPHEUS: your mind, driving you mad.  It is\nMORPHEUS: this feeling that brought you to\nMORPHEUS: me.  Do you know what I'm talking\nMORPHEUS: about?\nNEO: The Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: Do you want to know what it is?\nScene description: Neo swallows hard and nods.\nScene description: 29.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is everywhere, it's all\nMORPHEUS: around us, here even in this room.\nMORPHEUS: You can see it out your window or\nMORPHEUS: on your television.  You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.  Like\nMORPHEUS: everyone else, you were born into\nMORPHEUS: bondage, kept inside a prison that\nMORPHEUS: you cannot smell, taste, or touch.\nMORPHEUS: A prison for your mind.\nScene description: The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.\nMORPHEUS: Unfortunately, no one can be told\nMORPHEUS: what the Matrix is.  You have to\nMORPHEUS: see it for yourself.\nScene description: Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.\nScene description: In the left, a blue pill.\nMORPHEUS: This is your last chance.  After\nMORPHEUS: this, there is no going back.  You\nMORPHEUS: take the blue pill and the story\nMORPHEUS: ends.  You wake in your bed and\nMORPHEUS: you believe whatever you want to\nMORPHEUS: believe.\nScene description: The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.\nMORPHEUS: You take the red pill and you stay\nMORPHEUS: in Wonderland and I show you how\nMORPHEUS: deep the rabbit-hole goes.\nScene description: Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture\nScene description: growing in his palms.\nMORPHEUS: Remember that all I am offering is\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  Nothing more.\nScene description: Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The\nScene description: Cheshire smile returns.\nMORPHEUS: Follow me.",
