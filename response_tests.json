Trinity races to\nScene description: the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto\nScene description: the fire escape.\nScene description: Trinity steps out of Neo's room to find Cypher watching\nScene description: her.\nCYPHER: I don't remember you ever bringing\nCYPHER: me dinner.\nScene description: Trinity says nothing.\nCYPHER: There's something about him, isn't\nCYPHER: there?\nTRINITY: Don't tell me you're a believer\nTRINITY: now?\nScene description: 53.\nCYPHER: I just keep wondering if Morpheus\nCYPHER: is so sure, why doesn't he take\nCYPHER: him to the Oracle?  She would\nCYPHER: know.\nTRINITY: Morpheus will take him when he's\nTRINITY: ready.\nScene description: She turns and he watches her walk away.\nScene description: The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.\nScene description: 58.\nScene description: The long dark hall beckons.  Neo follows Morpheus out of\nScene description: the elevator and the DOORS RATTLE shut behind him.  With\nScene description: every step, a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in\nScene description: around him.\nScene description: At the end of the hall, Morpheus steps to the side of a\nScene description: door.\nMORPHEUS: I told you that I can only show\nMORPHEUS: you the door.  You have to step\nMORPHEUS: through it.\nScene description: Neo blows out a breath.  His hand reaches but stops,\nScene description: hovering over the spherical handle.  He backs away.\nNEO: Morpheus, I don't think this is a\nNEO: good idea.\nMORPHEUS: Why?\nNEO: I told you I don't believe in this\nNEO: stuff.  No matter what she says\nNEO: I'm not going to believe it, so\nNEO: what's the point?\nScene description: 68.\nMORPHEUS: What do you believe in?\nNEO: What do I believe in?  Are you\nNEO: kidding me?  What do you think?\nNEO: The world I grew up in isn't real.\nNEO: My entire life was a lie.  I don't\nNEO: believe in anything anymore.\nMORPHEUS: That's why we're here.\nNEO: Why?  So I can hear some old lady\nNEO: tell me, what?  That I'm this guy\nNEO: that everybody's been waiting for?\nNEO: That I'm supposed to save the\nNEO: world?  It sounds insane.\nNEO: Unbelievable.  And I don't care\nNEO: who says it, it's still going to\nNEO: sound insane and unbelievable.\nMORPHEUS: Faith is not a matter of\nMORPHEUS: reasonability.  I do not believe\nMORPHEUS: things with my mind.  I believe\nMORPHEUS: them with my heart.  In my gut.\nNEO: And you believe I'm the One?\nMORPHEUS: Yes I do.\nNEO: Yeah?  What about the other five\nNEO: guys?  The five before me?  What\nNEO: about them?\nScene description: Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his\nScene description: chest.\nNEO: Did you believe in them too?\nMORPHEUS: I believed what the Oracle told\nMORPHEUS: me... no, I misunderstood what she\nMORPHEUS: told me.  I believed that it was\nMORPHEUS: all about me.\nScene description: This is difficult for Morpheus to admit.\nScene description: 69.\nMORPHEUS: I believed that all I had to do\nMORPHEUS: was point my finger and anoint\nMORPHEUS: whoever I chose.  I was wrong,\nMORPHEUS: Neo.  Terribly wrong.  Not a day\nMORPHEUS: or night passes that I do not\nMORPHEUS: think of them.  After the fifth, I\nMORPHEUS: lost my way.  I doubted everything\nMORPHEUS: the Oracle had said.  I doubted\nMORPHEUS: myself.\nScene description: He looks up at Neo.\nMORPHEUS: And then I saw you, Neo, and my\nMORPHEUS: world changed.  You can call it\nMORPHEUS: an epiphany, you can call it\nMORPHEUS: whatever the hell you want.\nMORPHEUS: It doesn't matter.  It's not\nMORPHEUS: about a word.  It's about this.\nMORPHEUS: So I can't explain it to you.\nMORPHEUS: All I can do is believe, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: believe that one day you will\nMORPHEUS: feel what I felt and know what\nMORPHEUS: I know; you are the sixth and\nMORPHEUS: the last.  You are the One.\nScene description: His eyes blaze.\nMORPHEUS: Until that time all I am asking\nMORPHEUS: from you is for you to hold on to\nMORPHEUS: whatever respect you may have for\nMORPHEUS: me and trust me.\nScene description: Neo feels a rush from Morpheus's intensity, the\nScene description: unadulterated confidence of a zealot.\nNEO: All right.\nScene description: He reaches for the handle which turns without him even\nScene description: touching it.  A WOMAN wearing white opens the door.\nPRIESTESS: Hello, Neo.  You're right on time.\nScene description: Agent Smith screams, his calm machine-like expression\nScene description: shredding with pure rage.\nScene description: He rushes Neo.  His attack is ferocious but Neo blocks\nScene description: each blow easily.  Then with one quick strike to the\nScene description: chest he sends Agent Smith flying backwards.\nScene description: For the first time since their inception, the Agents know\nScene description: fear.\nScene description: Agent Smith gets up, bracing himself as Neo charges him\nScene description: and springs into a dive.  But the impact doesn't come.\nScene description: Neo sinks into Agent Smith, disappearing, his tie and coat\nScene description: rippling as if he were a deep pool of water.\nScene description: Spinning around he looks to the others and feels\nScene description: something, like a tremor before a quake, something deep,\nScene description: something that is going to change everything.\nScene description: Suddenly a SEARING SOUND stabs through his earpiece as\nScene description: his chest begins to swell, then balloon as/nobreakspace--\nScene description: Neo BURSTS up out of him.  And with a final death scream,\nScene description: Agent Smith EXPLODES like an empty husk in a brilliant\nScene description: cacophony of light, his shards spinning away, absorbed by\nScene description: the Matrix until/nobreakspace--\nScene description: Only Neo is left.\nScene description: Neo faces the remaining Agents.  They look at each other,\nScene description: the same idea striking simultaneously/nobreakspace--\nScene description: They run.\nScene description: 124.\nScene description: Again he hears her.  He reacts to the RINGING PHONE,\nScene description: rushing toward it even as/nobreakspace--",

He turns and his\nScene description: smile lights up the room.  A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes\nScene description: the old building.\nMORPHEUS: At last.\nScene description: He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible\nScene description: behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and\nScene description: they shake hands.\nMORPHEUS: Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt\nMORPHEUS: have guessed, I am Morpheus.\nNEO: It's an honor.\nMORPHEUS: No, the honor is mine.  Please.\nMORPHEUS: Come.  Sit.\nScene description: He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an\nScene description: adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in\nScene description: cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.\nMORPHEUS: I imagine, right now, you must be\nMORPHEUS: feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\nMORPHEUS: down the rabbit hole?\nNEO: You could say that.\nMORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes.  You\nMORPHEUS: have the look of a man who accepts\nMORPHEUS: what he sees because he is\nMORPHEUS: expecting to wake up.\nScene description: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.\nScene description: 28.\nMORPHEUS: Ironically, this is not far from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  But I'm getting ahead\nMORPHEUS: of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: why are you here?\nNEO: You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.\nNEO: Most hackers would die to meet\nNEO: you.\nMORPHEUS: Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we\nMORPHEUS: both know there's more to it than\nMORPHEUS: that.  Do you believe in fate,\nMORPHEUS: Neo?\nNEO: No.\nMORPHEUS: Why not?\nNEO: Because I don't like the idea that\nNEO: I'm not in control of my life.\nMORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean.\nScene description: Again, that smile that could cut glass.\nMORPHEUS: Let me tell you why you are here.\nMORPHEUS: You have come because you know\nMORPHEUS: something.  What you know you\nMORPHEUS: can't explain but you feel it.\nMORPHEUS: You've felt it your whole life,\nMORPHEUS: felt that something is wrong with\nMORPHEUS: the world.  You don't know what,\nMORPHEUS: but it's there like a splinter in\nMORPHEUS: your mind, driving you mad.  It is\nMORPHEUS: this feeling that brought you to\nMORPHEUS: me.  Do you know what I'm talking\nMORPHEUS: about?\nNEO: The Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: Do you want to know what it is?\nScene description: Neo swallows hard and nods.\nScene description: 29.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is everywhere, it's all\nMORPHEUS: around us, here even in this room.\nMORPHEUS: You can see it out your window or\nMORPHEUS: on your television.  You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.  Like\nMORPHEUS: everyone else, you were born into\nMORPHEUS: bondage, kept inside a prison that\nMORPHEUS: you cannot smell, taste, or touch.\nMORPHEUS: A prison for your mind.\nScene description: The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.\nMORPHEUS: Unfortunately, no one can be told\nMORPHEUS: what the Matrix is.  You have to\nMORPHEUS: see it for yourself.\nScene description: Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.\nScene description: In the left, a blue pill.\nMORPHEUS: This is your last chance.  After\nMORPHEUS: this, there is no going back.  You\nMORPHEUS: take the blue pill and the story\nMORPHEUS: ends.  You wake in your bed and\nMORPHEUS: you believe whatever you want to\nMORPHEUS: believe.\nScene description: The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.\nMORPHEUS: You take the red pill and you stay\nMORPHEUS: in Wonderland and I show you how\nMORPHEUS: deep the rabbit-hole goes.\nScene description: Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture\nScene description: growing in his palms.\nMORPHEUS: Remember that all I am offering is\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  Nothing more.\nScene description: Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The\nScene description: Cheshire smile returns.\nMORPHEUS: Follow me.",

There is a futuristic IV plugged into\nScene description: the jack in his forearm.

It is dangerous.\nMORPHEUS: They have trouble letting go.\nMORPHEUS: Their mind turns against them.\nMORPHEUS: I've seen it happen.  I'm sorry.\nMORPHEUS: I broke the rule because I had to.\nScene description: He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to\nScene description: himself as to Neo.\nMORPHEUS: When the Matrix was first built\nMORPHEUS: there was a man born inside that\nMORPHEUS: had the ability to change what he\nMORPHEUS: wanted, to remake the Matrix as he\nMORPHEUS: saw fit.  It was this man that\nMORPHEUS: freed the first of us and taught\nMORPHEUS: us the truth; as long as the\nMORPHEUS: Matrix exists, the human race will\nMORPHEUS: never be free.\nScene description: He pauses.\nScene description: 44.\nMORPHEUS: When he died, the Oracle\nMORPHEUS: prophesied his return and\nMORPHEUS: envisioned that his coming would\nMORPHEUS: hail the destruction of the\nMORPHEUS: Matrix, an end to the war and\nMORPHEUS: freedom for our people.  That is\nMORPHEUS: why there are those of us that\nMORPHEUS: have spent our entire lives\nMORPHEUS: searching the Matrix, looking for\nMORPHEUS: him.\nScene description: Neo can feel his eyes on him.\nMORPHEUS: I did what I did because I believe\nMORPHEUS: the search is over.\nScene description: He stands up.\nMORPHEUS: Get some rest.  You're going to\nMORPHEUS: need it.\nNEO: For what?\nMORPHEUS: Your training.\nScene description: Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The\nScene description: door opens and TANK steps inside.\nTANK: Morning.  Did you sleep?\nNEO: No.\nTANK: You will tonight.  I guarantee it.\nTANK: I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.\nScene description: He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that\nScene description: Tank doesn't have any jacks.\nScene description: 45.\nNEO: You don't have...\nTANK: Any holes?  Nope.

The only\nTANK: place we got left.\nNEO: Where is it?\nTANK: Deep underground.  Near the\nTANK: earth's core, where it's still\nTANK: warm.  You live long enough, you\nTANK: might even see it.\nTANK: (he smiles)\nTANK: Goddamn, I got to tell you, I'm\nTANK: fairly excited to see what you are\nTANK: capable of.

Someone says to you, 'What do you do?' and you reply, 'I'm a doctor,' they say, 'Oh, you treat the sick.' But if you say, 'I'm a microbiologist,' they say, 'Oh, you study bacteria.' Well, what do bacteria do? They grow. They multiply. They spread. And if you notice, that is exactly what humans do. They reproduce, they spread, they multiply, and they evolve. Agent Smith says that \"Humans are a disease, a virus.\" The metaphor is clear, comparing humans to a virus because of their tendency to reproduce and spread, much like a pathogen. This view is articulated by Agent Smith during the interrogation scene, revealing his perspective on humanity as a form of infestation or a destructive force within the system.'",
