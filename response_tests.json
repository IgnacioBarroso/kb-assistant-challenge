You have to step\nMORPHEUS: through it.\nScene description: Neo blows out a breath.  His hand reaches but stops,\nScene description: hovering over the spherical handle.  He backs away.\nNEO: Morpheus, I don't think this is a\nNEO: good idea.\nMORPHEUS: Why?\nNEO: I told you I don't believe in this\nNEO: stuff.  No matter what she says\nNEO: I'm not going to believe it, so\nNEO: what's the point?\nScene description: 68.\nMORPHEUS: What do you believe in?\nNEO: What do I believe in?  Are you\nNEO: kidding me?  What do you think?\nNEO: The world I grew up in isn't real.\nNEO: My entire life was a lie.

And I don't care\nNEO: who says it, it's still going to\nNEO: sound insane and unbelievable.\nMORPHEUS: Faith is not a matter of\nMORPHEUS: reasonability.  I do not believe\nMORPHEUS: things with my mind.  I believe\nMORPHEUS: them with my heart.  In my gut.\nNEO: And you believe I'm the One?\nMORPHEUS: Yes I do.\nNEO: Yeah?  What about the other five\nNEO: guys?  The five before me?  What\nNEO: about them?\nScene description: Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his\nScene description: chest.\nNEO: Did you believe in them too?\nMORPHEUS: I believed what the Oracle told\nMORPHEUS: me... no, I misunderstood what she\nMORPHEUS: told me.  I believed that it was\nMORPHEUS: all about me.\nScene description: This is difficult for Morpheus to admit.\nScene description: 69.\nMORPHEUS: I believed that all I had to do\nMORPHEUS: was point my finger and anoint\nMORPHEUS: whoever I chose.  I was wrong,\nMORPHEUS: Neo.  Terribly wrong.  Not a day\nMORPHEUS: or night passes that I do not\nMORPHEUS: think of them.  After the fifth, I\nMORPHEUS: lost my way.  I doubted everything\nMORPHEUS: the Oracle had said.  I doubted\nMORPHEUS: myself.\nScene description: He looks up at Neo.\nMORPHEUS: And then I saw you, Neo, and my\nMORPHEUS: world changed.

You are the One.\nScene description: His eyes blaze.\nMORPHEUS: Until that time all I am asking\nMORPHEUS: from you is for you to hold on to\nMORPHEUS: whatever respect you may have for\nMORPHEUS: me and trust me.\nScene description: Neo feels a rush from Morpheus's intensity, the\nScene description: unadulterated confidence of a zealot.\nNEO: All right.\nScene description: He reaches for the handle which turns without him even\nScene description: touching it.

You're right on time.\nScene description: Agent Smith screams, his calm machine-like expression\nScene description: shredding with pure rage.\nScene description: He rushes Neo.

Please.\nMORPHEUS: Come.  Sit.\nScene description: He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an\nScene description: adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in\nScene description: cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.\nMORPHEUS: I imagine, right now, you must be\nMORPHEUS: feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\nMORPHEUS: down the rabbit hole?\nNEO: You could say that.\nMORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes.  You\nMORPHEUS: have the look of a man who accepts\nMORPHEUS: what he sees because he is\nMORPHEUS: expecting to wake up.\nScene description: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.\nScene description: 28.\nMORPHEUS: Ironically, this is not far from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  But I'm getting ahead\nMORPHEUS: of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: why are you here?\nNEO: You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.\nNEO: Most hackers would die to meet\nNEO: you.\nMORPHEUS: Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we\nMORPHEUS: both know there's more to it than\nMORPHEUS: that.  Do you believe in fate,\nMORPHEUS: Neo?\nNEO: No.\nMORPHEUS: Why not?\nNEO: Because I don't like the idea that\nNEO: I'm not in control of my life.\nMORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean.\nScene description: Again, that smile that could cut glass.\nMORPHEUS: Let me tell you why you are here.\nMORPHEUS: You have come because you know\nMORPHEUS: something.  What you know you\nMORPHEUS: can't explain but you feel it.\nMORPHEUS: You've felt it your whole life,\nMORPHEUS: felt that something is wrong with\nMORPHEUS: the world.  You don't know what,\nMORPHEUS: but it's there like a splinter in\nMORPHEUS: your mind, driving you mad.  It is\nMORPHEUS: this feeling that brought you to\nMORPHEUS: me.  Do you know what I'm talking\nMORPHEUS: about?\nNEO: The Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: Do you want to know what it is?\nScene description: Neo swallows hard and nods.\nScene description: 29.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is everywhere, it's all\nMORPHEUS: around us, here even in this room.\nMORPHEUS: You can see it out your window or\nMORPHEUS: on your television.  You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.  Like\nMORPHEUS: everyone else, you were born into\nMORPHEUS: bondage, kept inside a prison that\nMORPHEUS: you cannot smell, taste, or touch.\nMORPHEUS: A prison for your mind.\nScene description: The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.\nMORPHEUS: Unfortunately, no one can be told\nMORPHEUS: what the Matrix is.  You have to\nMORPHEUS: see it for yourself.\nScene description: Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.\nScene description: In the left, a blue pill.\nMORPHEUS: This is your last chance.  After\nMORPHEUS: this, there is no going back.  You\nMORPHEUS: take the blue pill and the story\nMORPHEUS: ends.  You wake in your bed and\nMORPHEUS: you believe whatever you want to\nMORPHEUS: believe.\nScene description: The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.\nMORPHEUS: You take the red pill and you stay\nMORPHEUS: in Wonderland and I show you how\nMORPHEUS: deep the rabbit-hole goes.\nScene description: Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture\nScene description: growing in his palms.\nMORPHEUS: Remember that all I am offering is\nMORPHEUS: the truth.

That is\nMORPHEUS: why there are those of us that\nMORPHEUS: have spent our entire lives\nMORPHEUS: searching the Matrix, looking for\nMORPHEUS: him.\nScene description: Neo can feel his eyes on him.\nMORPHEUS: I did what I did because I believe\nMORPHEUS: the search is over.\nScene description: He stands up.\nMORPHEUS: Get some rest.

His enjoyment of simple pleasures like eating steak and drinking wine further underscores his hedonistic tendencies. Cypher also demonstrates a calculating nature, as he plots with Agent Smith to betray his comrades and regain his luxury-filled life, revealing a pragmatic and somewhat morally flexible personality.",

      "answer": "The human fields depicted in the script serve as sites where human beings are grown and harvested by the Machines, rather than born. Morpheus describes these fields as places 'where human beings are no longer born; we are grown,' indicating their purpose is to cultivate humans for the Machines' use. The fields are used to produce human bioelectricity, as Morpheus explains, 'The Machines discovered a new form of fusion,' and they create a reaction initiated by a small electrical charge, harnessing the human body's bioelectricity and heat. The creation of these fields appears to be the Machines' deliberate effort to sustain their energy needs by cultivating humans as a resource.",
