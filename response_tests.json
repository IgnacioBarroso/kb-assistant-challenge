Terribly wrong.  Not a day\nMORPHEUS: or night passes that I do not\nMORPHEUS: think of them.  After the fifth, I\nMORPHEUS: lost my way.  I doubted everything\nMORPHEUS: the Oracle had said.  I doubted\nMORPHEUS: myself.\"\n- \"MORPHEUS: And then I saw you, Neo, and my\nMORPHEUS: world changed.

He turns and his\nScene description: smile lights up the room.  A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes\nScene description: the old building.\nMORPHEUS: At last.\nScene description: He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible\nScene description: behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and\nScene description: they shake hands.\nMORPHEUS: Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt\nMORPHEUS: have guessed, I am Morpheus.\nNEO: It's an honor.\nMORPHEUS: No, the honor is mine.  Please.\nMORPHEUS: Come.  Sit.\nScene description: He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an\nScene description: adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in\nScene description: cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.\nMORPHEUS: I imagine, right now, you must be\nMORPHEUS: feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\nMORPHEUS: down the rabbit hole?\nNEO: You could say that.\nMORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes.  You\nMORPHEUS: have the look of a man who accepts\nMORPHEUS: what he sees because he is\nMORPHEUS: expecting to wake up.\nScene description: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.\nScene description: 28.\nMORPHEUS: Ironically, this is not far from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  But I'm getting ahead\nMORPHEUS: of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: why are you here?\nNEO: You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.\nNEO: Most hackers would die to meet\nNEO: you.\nMORPHEUS: Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we\nMORPHEUS: both know there's more to it than\nMORPHEUS: that.  Do you believe in fate,\nMORPHEUS: Neo?\nNEO: No.\nMORPHEUS: Why not?\nNEO: Because I don't like the idea that\nNEO: I'm not in control of my life.\nMORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean.\nScene description: Again, that smile that could cut glass.\nMORPHEUS: Let me tell you why you are here.\nMORPHEUS: You have come because you know\nMORPHEUS: something.  What you know you\nMORPHEUS: can't explain but you feel it.\nMORPHEUS: You've felt it your whole life,\nMORPHEUS: felt that something is wrong with\nMORPHEUS: the world.  You don't know what,\nMORPHEUS: but it's there like a splinter in\nMORPHEUS: your mind, driving you mad.  It is\nMORPHEUS: this feeling that brought you to\nMORPHEUS: me.  Do you know what I'm talking\nMORPHEUS: about?\nNEO: The Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: Do you want to know what it is?\nScene description: Neo swallows hard and nods.\nScene description: 29.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is everywhere, it's all\nMORPHEUS: around us, here even in this room.\nMORPHEUS: You can see it out your window or\nMORPHEUS: on your television.  You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.  Like\nMORPHEUS: everyone else, you were born into\nMORPHEUS: bondage, kept inside a prison that\nMORPHEUS: you cannot smell, taste, or touch.\nMORPHEUS: A prison for your mind.\nScene description: The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.\nMORPHEUS: Unfortunately, no one can be told\nMORPHEUS: what the Matrix is.  You have to\nMORPHEUS: see it for yourself.\nScene description: Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.\nScene description: In the left, a blue pill.\nMORPHEUS: This is your last chance.  After\nMORPHEUS: this, there is no going back.  You\nMORPHEUS: take the blue pill and the story\nMORPHEUS: ends.  You wake in your bed and\nMORPHEUS: you believe whatever you want to\nMORPHEUS: believe.\nScene description: The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.\nMORPHEUS: You take the red pill and you stay\nMORPHEUS: in Wonderland and I show you how\nMORPHEUS: deep the rabbit-hole goes.\nScene description: Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture\nScene description: growing in his palms.\nMORPHEUS: Remember that all I am offering is\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  Nothing more.\nScene description: Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The\nScene description: Cheshire smile returns.\nMORPHEUS: Follow me.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided script excerpts, Agent Smith states that humans are similar to a virus. He explains that he classifies humans not as mammals, but as organisms that act instinctively to develop a natural equilibrium with their environment. Instead, humans are described as moving into areas, multiplying, and consuming all resources until they have to spread elsewhere, which closely resembles the behavior of a virus. He explicitly says, 'There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus.' Furthermore, Agent Smith explicitly states, 'Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague. And we are... the cure.' Therefore, Agent Smith is the character who makes the comparison between humans and viruses.",

From the script, it is evident that he is pragmatic, self-interested, and weary of the war in the matrix, expressing fatigue and a desire for comfort and wealth. He openly admits to being tired of fighting, tired of the ship, and tired of the 'bullshit,' indicating a cynical and disillusioned side. Despite this, he is also manipulative and treacherous, as shown by his willingness to betray his comrades for personal gain, aiming to return to the illusion of the Matrix for riches and importance. Cypher also shows a capacity for deceit and manipulation, such as when he betrays Morpheus and the team, and his bitter, mocking attitude when he discusses the reality of death and the artificial nature of the Matrix.",

Shit, Neo, you scared the\nCYPHER: bejeezus out of me.\nNEO: Sorry.\nCYPHER: No, it's all right.\nScene description: Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens\nScene description: that seem alive with a constant flow of data.\nNEO: Is that...?\nCYPHER: The Matrix?  Yeah.\nScene description: Neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of\nScene description: information, bizarre codes and equations flowing across\nScene description: the face of the monitor.\nNEO: Do you always look at it encoded?\nCYPHER: Have to.  The image translators\nCYPHER: sort of work for the construct\nCYPHER: programs but there's way too much\nCYPHER: information to decode the Matrix.\nCYPHER: You get used to it, though.  Your\nCYPHER: brain does the translating.  I\nCYPHER: don't even see the code.  All I\nCYPHER: see is blonde, brunette, and\nCYPHER: redhead.  You want a drink?\nScene description: Neo nods and he pours a clear alcohol from a plastic jug.\nCYPHER: You know, I know what you're\nCYPHER: thinking 'cause right now I'm\nCYPHER: thinking the same thing.\nCYPHER: Actually, to tell you the truth,\nCYPHER: I've been thinking the same thing\nCYPHER: ever since I got here.\nScene description: He raises the glass.\nCYPHER: Why, oh why, didn't I take that\nCYPHER: blue pill?\nScene description: He throws the shot down his throat.  Neo does the same\nScene description: and it almost kills him.  Smiling, Cypher slaps him on\nScene description: the back.\nCYPHER: Good shit, eh?  Dozer makes it.\nCYPHER: It's good for two things:\nCYPHER: degreasing engines and killing\nCYPHER: brain cells.\nScene description: Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.  Cypher pours him\nScene description: another.\nCYPHER: Can I ask you something?  Did he\nCYPHER: happen to tell you why he did it?\nScene description: Neo looks up, unsure.\nCYPHER: Why you're here?\nNEO: ... Yeah.\nCYPHER: Gee-zus!  What a mindjob.  You're\nCYPHER: here to save the world.  You gotta\nCYPHER: be shitting me.  What do you say\nCYPHER: to something like that?\nScene description: Neo looks down at his drink.\nCYPHER: I'm going to let you in on a\nCYPHER: little secret here.  Now don't\nCYPHER: tell him I told you this, but this\nCYPHER: ain't the first time Morpheus\nCYPHER: thought he found the One.\nNEO: Really?\nCYPHER: You bet your ass.  It keeps him\nCYPHER: going.  Maybe it keeps all of us\nCYPHER: going.\nNEO: How many were there?\nScene description: 60.\nCYPHER: Five.  Since I've been here.\nNEO: What happened to them?\nCYPHER: Dead.  All dead.\nNEO: How?\nCYPHER: Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them\nCYPHER: all amped up believing in\nCYPHER: bullshit.  I watched each of them\nCYPHER: take on an Agent and I watched\nCYPHER: each of them die.  Little piece of\nCYPHER: advice:  you see an Agent, you do\nCYPHER: what we do; run.
