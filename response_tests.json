Trinity races to\nScene description: the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto\nScene description: the fire escape.\nScene description: Trinity steps out of Neo's room to find Cypher watching\nScene description: her.\nCYPHER: I don't remember you ever bringing\nCYPHER: me dinner.\nScene description: Trinity says nothing.\nCYPHER: There's something about him, isn't\nCYPHER: there?\nTRINITY: Don't tell me you're a believer\nTRINITY: now?\nScene description: 53.\nCYPHER: I just keep wondering if Morpheus\nCYPHER: is so sure, why doesn't he take\nCYPHER: him to the Oracle?  She would\nCYPHER: know.\nTRINITY: Morpheus will take him when he's\nTRINITY: ready.\nScene description: She turns and he watches her walk away.\nScene description: The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.\nScene description: 58.\nScene description: The long dark hall beckons.  Neo follows Morpheus out of\nScene description: the elevator and the DOORS RATTLE shut behind him.  With\nScene description: every step, a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in\nScene description: around him.\nScene description: At the end of the hall, Morpheus steps to the side of a\nScene description: door.\nMORPHEUS: I told you that I can only show\nMORPHEUS: you the door.  You have to step\nMORPHEUS: through it.\nScene description: Neo blows out a breath.  His hand reaches but stops,\nScene description: hovering over the spherical handle.  He backs away.\nNEO: Morpheus, I don't think this is a\nNEO: good idea.\nMORPHEUS: Why?\nNEO: I told you I don't believe in this\nNEO: stuff.  No matter what she says\nNEO: I'm not going to believe it, so\nNEO: what's the point?\nScene description: 68.\nMORPHEUS: What do you believe in?\nNEO: What do I believe in?  Are you\nNEO: kidding me?  What do you think?\nNEO: The world I grew up in isn't real.\nNEO: My entire life was a lie.  I don't\nNEO: believe in anything anymore.\nMORPHEUS: That's why we're here.\nNEO: Why?  So I can hear some old lady\nNEO: tell me, what?  That I'm this guy\nNEO: that everybody's been waiting for?\nNEO: That I'm supposed to save the\nNEO: world?  It sounds insane.\nNEO: Unbelievable.  And I don't care\nNEO: who says it, it's still going to\nNEO: sound insane and unbelievable.\nMORPHEUS: Faith is not a matter of\nMORPHEUS: reasonability.  I do not believe\nMORPHEUS: things with my mind.  I believe\nMORPHEUS: them with my heart.  In my gut.\nNEO: And you believe I'm the One?\nMORPHEUS: Yes I do.\nNEO: Yeah?  What about the other five\nNEO: guys?  The five before me?  What\nNEO: about them?\nScene description: Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his\nScene description: chest.\nNEO: Did you believe in them too?\nMORPHEUS: I believed what the Oracle told\nMORPHEUS: me... no, I misunderstood what she\nMORPHEUS: told me.  I believed that it was\nMORPHEUS: all about me.\nScene description: This is difficult for Morpheus to admit.\nScene description: 69.\nMORPHEUS: I believed that all I had to do\nMORPHEUS: was point my finger and anoint\nMORPHEUS: whoever I chose.  I was wrong,\nMORPHEUS: Neo.  Terribly wrong.  Not a day\nMORPHEUS: or night passes that I do not\nMORPHEUS: think of them.  After the fifth, I\nMORPHEUS: lost my way.  I doubted everything\nMORPHEUS: the Oracle had said.  I doubted\nMORPHEUS: myself.\nScene description: He looks up at Neo.\nMORPHEUS: And then I saw you, Neo, and my\nMORPHEUS: world changed.  You can call it\nMORPHEUS: an epiphany, you can call it\nMORPHEUS: whatever the hell you want.\nMORPHEUS: It doesn't matter.  It's not\nMORPHEUS: about a word.  It's about this.\nMORPHEUS: So I can't explain it to you.\nMORPHEUS: All I can do is believe, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: believe that one day you will\nMORPHEUS: feel what I felt and know what\nMORPHEUS: I know; you are the sixth and\nMORPHEUS: the last.  You are the One.\nScene description: His eyes blaze.\nMORPHEUS: Until that time all I am asking\nMORPHEUS: from you is for you to hold on to\nMORPHEUS: whatever respect you may have for\nMORPHEUS: me and trust me.\nScene description: Neo feels a rush from Morpheus's intensity, the\nScene description: unadulterated confidence of a zealot.\nNEO: All right.\nScene description: He reaches for the handle which turns without him even\nScene description: touching it.  A WOMAN wearing white opens the door.\nPRIESTESS: Hello, Neo.  You're right on time.\nScene description: Agent Smith screams, his calm machine-like expression\nScene description: shredding with pure rage.\nScene description: He rushes Neo.  His attack is ferocious but Neo blocks\nScene description: each blow easily.  Then with one quick strike to the\nScene description: chest he sends Agent Smith flying backwards.\nScene description: For the first time since their inception, the Agents know\nScene description: fear.\nScene description: Agent Smith gets up, bracing himself as Neo charges him\nScene description: and springs into a dive.  But the impact doesn't come.\nScene description: Neo sinks into Agent Smith, disappearing, his tie and coat\nScene description: rippling as if he were a deep pool of water.\nScene description: Spinning around he looks to the others and feels\nScene description: something, like a tremor before a quake, something deep,\nScene description: something that is going to change everything.\nScene description: Suddenly a SEARING SOUND stabs through his earpiece as\nScene description: his chest begins to swell, then balloon as/nobreakspace--\nScene description: Neo BURSTS up out of him.  And with a final death scream,\nScene description: Agent Smith EXPLODES like an empty husk in a brilliant\nScene description: cacophony of light, his shards spinning away, absorbed by\nScene description: the Matrix until/nobreakspace--\nScene description: Only Neo is left.\nScene description: Neo faces the remaining Agents.  They look at each other,\nScene description: the same idea striking simultaneously/nobreakspace--\nScene description: They run.\nScene description: 124.\nScene description: Again he hears her.

He turns and his\nScene description: smile lights up the room.  A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes\nScene description: the old building.\nMORPHEUS: At last.\nScene description: He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible\nScene description: behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and\nScene description: they shake hands.\nMORPHEUS: Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt\nMORPHEUS: have guessed, I am Morpheus.\nNEO: It's an honor.\nMORPHEUS: No, the honor is mine.  Please.\nMORPHEUS: Come.  Sit.\nScene description: He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an\nScene description: adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in\nScene description: cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.\nMORPHEUS: I imagine, right now, you must be\nMORPHEUS: feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling\nMORPHEUS: down the rabbit hole?\nNEO: You could say that.\nMORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes.  You\nMORPHEUS: have the look of a man who accepts\nMORPHEUS: what he sees because he is\nMORPHEUS: expecting to wake up.\nScene description: A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.\nScene description: 28.\nMORPHEUS: Ironically, this is not far from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  But I'm getting ahead\nMORPHEUS: of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: why are you here?\nNEO: You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.\nNEO: Most hackers would die to meet\nNEO: you.\nMORPHEUS: Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we\nMORPHEUS: both know there's more to it than\nMORPHEUS: that.  Do you believe in fate,\nMORPHEUS: Neo?\nNEO: No.\nMORPHEUS: Why not?\nNEO: Because I don't like the idea that\nNEO: I'm not in control of my life.\nMORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean.\nScene description: Again, that smile that could cut glass.\nMORPHEUS: Let me tell you why you are here.\nMORPHEUS: You have come because you know\nMORPHEUS: something.  What you know you\nMORPHEUS: can't explain but you feel it.\nMORPHEUS: You've felt it your whole life,\nMORPHEUS: felt that something is wrong with\nMORPHEUS: the world.  You don't know what,\nMORPHEUS: but it's there like a splinter in\nMORPHEUS: your mind, driving you mad.  It is\nMORPHEUS: this feeling that brought you to\nMORPHEUS: me.  Do you know what I'm talking\nMORPHEUS: about?\nNEO: The Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: Do you want to know what it is?\nScene description: Neo swallows hard and nods.\nScene description: 29.\nMORPHEUS: The Matrix is everywhere, it's all\nMORPHEUS: around us, here even in this room.\nMORPHEUS: You can see it out your window or\nMORPHEUS: on your television.  You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.  Like\nMORPHEUS: everyone else, you were born into\nMORPHEUS: bondage, kept inside a prison that\nMORPHEUS: you cannot smell, taste, or touch.\nMORPHEUS: A prison for your mind.\nScene description: The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.\nMORPHEUS: Unfortunately, no one can be told\nMORPHEUS: what the Matrix is.  You have to\nMORPHEUS: see it for yourself.\nScene description: Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.\nScene description: In the left, a blue pill.\nMORPHEUS: This is your last chance.  After\nMORPHEUS: this, there is no going back.  You\nMORPHEUS: take the blue pill and the story\nMORPHEUS: ends.  You wake in your bed and\nMORPHEUS: you believe whatever you want to\nMORPHEUS: believe.\nScene description: The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.\nMORPHEUS: You take the red pill and you stay\nMORPHEUS: in Wonderland and I show you how\nMORPHEUS: deep the rabbit-hole goes.\nScene description: Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture\nScene description: growing in his palms.\nMORPHEUS: Remember that all I am offering is\nMORPHEUS: the truth.  Nothing more.\nScene description: Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The\nScene description: Cheshire smile returns.\nMORPHEUS: Follow me.",

It is dangerous.\nMORPHEUS: They have trouble letting go.\nMORPHEUS: Their mind turns against them.\nMORPHEUS: I've seen it happen.  I'm sorry.\nMORPHEUS: I broke the rule because I had to.\nScene description: He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to\nScene description: himself as to Neo.\nMORPHEUS: When the Matrix was first built\nMORPHEUS: there was a man born inside that\nMORPHEUS: had the ability to change what he\nMORPHEUS: wanted, to remake the Matrix as he\nMORPHEUS: saw fit.  It was this man that\nMORPHEUS: freed the first of us and taught\nMORPHEUS: us the truth; as long as the\nMORPHEUS: Matrix exists, the human race will\nMORPHEUS: never be free.\nScene description: He pauses.\nScene description: 44.\nMORPHEUS: When he died, the Oracle\nMORPHEUS: prophesied his return and\nMORPHEUS: envisioned that his coming would\nMORPHEUS: hail the destruction of the\nMORPHEUS: Matrix, an end to the war and\nMORPHEUS: freedom for our people.  That is\nMORPHEUS: why there are those of us that\nMORPHEUS: have spent our entire lives\nMORPHEUS: searching the Matrix, looking for\nMORPHEUS: him.\nScene description: Neo can feel his eyes on him.\nMORPHEUS: I did what I did because I believe\nMORPHEUS: the search is over.\nScene description: He stands up.\nMORPHEUS: Get some rest.  You're going to\nMORPHEUS: need it.\nNEO: For what?\nMORPHEUS: Your training.\nScene description: Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The\nScene description: door opens and TANK steps inside.\nTANK: Morning.  Did you sleep?\nNEO: No.\nTANK: You will tonight.  I guarantee it.\nTANK: I'm Tank.

Or\nMORPHEUS: were you looking at the woman in\nMORPHEUS: the red dress?\nNEO: I was...\nScene description: 54.\nMORPHEUS: Look again.\nScene description: Neo turns just as Agent Smith levels a gun at his face.\nScene description: Neo screams.\nMORPHEUS: Freeze it.\nScene description: Everything except Morpheus and Neo freezes.\nNEO: This -- this isn't the Matrix?\nMORPHEUS: No, it's another training program\nMORPHEUS: designed to teach you one thing;\nMORPHEUS: if you are not one of us, you're\nMORPHEUS: one of them.\nNEO: What are they?\nMORPHEUS: Sentient programs.  They can move\nMORPHEUS: in and out of any software still\nMORPHEUS: hardwired to their system.  That\nMORPHEUS: means that anyone that we haven't\nMORPHEUS: unplugged is potentially an Agent.\nMORPHEUS: Inside the Matrix, they are\nMORPHEUS: everyone and they are no one.\nScene description: Neo stares at the Agent.\nMORPHEUS: We've survived by hiding from\nMORPHEUS: them, running from them, but they\nMORPHEUS: are the gatekeepers, they're\nMORPHEUS: guarding all the doors, holding\nMORPHEUS: all the keys, which means that\nMORPHEUS: sooner or later someone is going\nMORPHEUS: to have to fight them.\nNEO: Someone?\nMORPHEUS: I won't lie to you, Neo.  Every\nMORPHEUS: single man or woman who has stood\nMORPHEUS: their ground, who has fought an\nMORPHEUS: Agent, has died.  But where they\nMORPHEUS: failed, you will succeed.\nNEO: Why?\nMORPHEUS: I've seen an Agent punch through a\nMORPHEUS: concrete wall.  Men have emptied\nMORPHEUS: entire clips at them and hit\nMORPHEUS: nothing but air.  Yet their\nMORPHEUS: strength and their speed are still\nMORPHEUS: based on a world that is built by\nMORPHEUS: rules.  Because of that they will\nMORPHEUS: never be as strong or as fast as\nMORPHEUS: you can be.\nScene description: Neo scratches his head.\nNEO: What?  Are you trying to tell me\nNEO: that I can dodge bullets?\nMORPHEUS: No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you\nMORPHEUS: that when you're ready, you won't\nMORPHEUS: have to.\nScene description: Morpheus' cell PHONE RINGS and he flips it open.\nTANK: We got trouble.",

You know\nMORPHEUS: most of my crew.\nScene description: Trinity smiles and nods.\nMORPHEUS: The ones you don't know.  That's\nMORPHEUS: Mouse, Cypher, and Switch.  Those\nMORPHEUS: two guys are Tank and Dozer.\nScene description: The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.\nMORPHEUS: And this, this is the Core.  This\nMORPHEUS: is where we broadcast our pirate\nMORPHEUS: signal and hack into the Matrix.\nScene description: It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of\nScene description: coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic\nScene description: battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks\nScene description: of life systems and computer monitors.\nScene description: At the center of the web, there are six ecto-skeleton\nScene description: chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.\nScene description: Near the circle of chairs is the control console and\nScene description: operator's station where the network is monitored.\nMORPHEUS: You want to know what the Matrix\nMORPHEUS: is, Neo?  The answer is right\nMORPHEUS: here.\nScene description: He touches the back of Neo's head.\nMORPHEUS: Help him, Trinity.\nScene description: Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.\nScene description: He feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at\nScene description: the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of\nScene description: cerebrum chip we saw inside the plant.\nScene description: 38.\nMORPHEUS: This will feel a little weird.\nScene description: There are several disturbing noises as he works the\nScene description: needle in.\nScene description: We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens\nScene description: into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop\nScene description: like when you equalize them underwater.\nScene description: He relaxes, opening his eyes as we PULL BACK to a feeling\nScene description: of weightlessness inside another place --\nScene description: His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,\nScene description: trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.\nNEO: Get this thing out of me!\nTRINITY: Easy, Neo.  Easy.\nScene description: Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,\nScene description: he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the\nScene description: harness.\nNEO: Don't touch me!  Get away from me!\nScene description: On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.\nScene description: Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull\nScene description: as if his brain had been put into a centrifuge.\nNEO: I don't believe it!  I don't\nNEO: believe it!\nScene description: 43.\nCYPHER: He's going to pop!\nScene description: Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.\nScene description: Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension\nScene description: chairs.\nScene description: 46.\nTANK: We're supposed to load all these\nTANK: operations programs first, but\nTANK: this is some major boring shit.\nTANK: Why don't we start with something\nTANK: a little fun?\nScene description: Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He\nScene description: begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro\nScene description: discs.\nTANK: How about some combat training?\nScene description: Neo reads the label on the disk.\nNEO: Jujitsu?  I'm going to learn\nNEO: jujitsu?\nScene description: Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.\nNEO: No way.\nScene description: Smiling, Tank punches the \"load\" code.  His body jumps\nScene description: against the harness as his eyes clamp shut.  The monitors\nScene description: kick wildly as his heart pounds, adrenaline surges, and\nScene description: his brain sizzles.  An instant later his eyes snap open.\nNEO: Holy shit!\nTANK: Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready\nTANK: for more?\nNEO: Hell yes!\nScene description: CLOSE ON a computer monitor as grey pixels slowly fill a\nScene description: small, half-empty box.  It is a meter displaying how much\nScene description: download time is left.\nScene description: The title bar reads:  \"Combat Series 10 of 12,\" file\nScene description: categories flashing beneath it:  \"Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,\nScene description: Drunken Boxing...\"\nScene description: Morpheus walks in.\nMORPHEUS: How is he?\nTANK: Ten hours straight.  He's a\nTANK: machine.\nScene description: Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath\nScene description: hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.\nNEO: This is incredible.  I know kung\nNEO: fu.\nMORPHEUS: Show me.\nScene description: While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the\nScene description: two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive\nScene description: chairs.\nScene description: Tank monitors their Life Systems, noticing that Neo is\nScene description: wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and\nScene description: steady rhythm of Morpheus.\nScene description: 48.\nScene description: Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,\nScene description: like watching a game of Mortal Kombat.\nMOUSE: Jeezus Keeerist!  He's fast!  Look\nMOUSE: at his neural-kinetics!  They're\nMOUSE: way above normal!\nScene description: There are several gasps.\nMOUSE: I don't believe it!\nScene description: They are transfixed.\nMOUSE: What if he makes it?\nAPOC: No way.  Not possible.\nTANK: No one's ever made their first\nTANK: jump.\nMOUSE: I know, but what if he does?\nAPOC: He won't.\nScene description: 51.\nScene description: Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she\nScene description: whispers.\nTRINITY: Come on.\nScene description: They break up.\nMOUSE: What does it mean?\nSWITCH: It doesn't mean anything.\nCYPHER: Everyone falls the first time,\nCYPHER: right, Trinity?\nScene description: But Trinity has already left.\nScene description: Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to\nScene description: move and groans, cradling his ribs.  While Tank helps\nScene description: Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.\nScene description: 52.\nNEO: I thought it wasn't real.\nMORPHEUS: Your mind makes it real.\nScene description: Neo stares at the blood.\nNEO: If you are killed in the Matrix,\nNEO: do you die here?\nMORPHEUS: The body cannot live without the\nMORPHEUS: mind.\nScene description: Tank works furiously at the operator's station as the\nScene description: ceaseless WHIR of the ship's TURBINES GRIND TO a HALT.\nScene description: The main deck is plunged into dark silence.  The rest\nScene description: of the screw stands behind him as he whispers.\nTANK: Power off-line.  E.M.P. armed and\nTANK: ready.\nScene description: Tank's fingers curl around a small key that glows a dim\nScene description: red.\nScene description: The core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the\nScene description: operator's chair as Neo comes up behind him.\nCYPHER: Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the\nCYPHER: bejeezus out of me.\nNEO: Sorry.\nCYPHER: No, it's all right.\nScene description: Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens\nScene description: that seem alive with a constant flow of data.\nNEO: Is that...?\nCYPHER: The Matrix?  Yeah.\nScene description: Neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of\nScene description: information, bizarre codes and equations flowing across\nScene description: the face of the monitor.\nNEO: Do you always look at it encoded?\nCYPHER: Have to.  The image translators\nCYPHER: sort of work for the construct\nCYPHER: programs but there's way too much\nCYPHER: information to decode the Matrix.\nCYPHER: You get used to it, though.  Your\nCYPHER: brain does the translating.  I\nCYPHER: don't even see the code.  All I\nCYPHER: see is blonde, brunette, and\nCYPHER: redhead.  You want a drink?\nScene description: Neo nods and he pours a clear alcohol from a plastic jug.\nCYPHER: You know, I know what you're\nCYPHER: thinking 'cause right now I'm\nCYPHER: thinking the same thing.\nCYPHER: Actually, to tell you the truth,\nCYPHER: I've been thinking the same thing\nCYPHER: ever since I got here.\nScene description: He raises the glass.\nCYPHER: Why, oh why, didn't I take that\nCYPHER: blue pill?\nScene description: He throws the shot down his throat.  Neo does the same\nScene description: and it almost kills him.  Smiling, Cypher slaps him on\nScene description: the back.\nCYPHER: Good shit, eh?  Dozer makes it.\nCYPHER: It's good for two things:\nCYPHER: degreasing engines and killing\nCYPHER: brain cells.\nScene description: Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.  Cypher pours him\nScene description: another.\nCYPHER: Can I ask you something?  Did he\nCYPHER: happen to tell you why he did it?\nScene description: Neo looks up, unsure.\nCYPHER: Why you're here?\nNEO: ... Yeah.\nCYPHER: Gee-zus!  What a mindjob.  You're\nCYPHER: here to save the world.  You gotta\nCYPHER: be shitting me.  What do you say\nCYPHER: to something like that?\nScene description: Neo looks down at his drink.\nCYPHER: I'm going to let you in on a\nCYPHER: little secret here.  Now don't\nCYPHER: tell him I told you this, but this\nCYPHER: ain't the first time Morpheus\nCYPHER: thought he found the One.\nNEO: Really?\nCYPHER: You bet your ass.  It keeps him\nCYPHER: going.  Maybe it keeps all of us\nCYPHER: going.\nNEO: How many were there?\nScene description: 60.\nCYPHER: Five.  Since I've been here.\nNEO: What happened to them?\nCYPHER: Dead.  All dead.\nNEO: How?\nCYPHER: Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them\nCYPHER: all amped up believing in\nCYPHER: bullshit.  I watched each of them\nCYPHER: take on an Agent and I watched\nCYPHER: each of them die.  Little piece of\nCYPHER: advice:  you see an Agent, you do\nCYPHER: what we do; run.  Run your ass\nCYPHER: off.\nScene description: Neo gulps down another shot.\nNEO: Thanks... for the drink.\nCYPHER: Anytime.\nScene description: Cypher nods as Neo heads for the ladder.\nCYPHER: Sweet dreams.\nScene description: Everyone is strapped into their chairs.  Tank is at the\nScene description: operator's station.\nTANK: All right, everyone please observe\nTANK: that the no smoking and fasten\nTANK: seat belt signs have been turned\nTANK: on.  Sit back and enjoy your\nTANK: flight.\nScene description: He strikes the enter key and we RUSH CLOCKWISE OVER the\nScene description: chairs, each body reacting as we...\nScene description: CUT TO:\nScene description: Sweat rolls down Cypher's face and neck.  At the\nScene description: operator's station, Tank is typing rapidly.\nTANK: What is that...?\nScene description: The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an\nScene description: electronic seizure.\nTANK: Oh shit!  Oh shit!\nScene description: Tank sees what was changed.\nTANK: It's a trap!\nScene description: Tank watches helplessly.\nTANK: No, no, no.\nScene description: Mouse's body thrashes against its harness, blood coughing\nScene description: from his mouth in one final spasm, then lying perfectly\nScene description: still.  The flatline ALARM softly cries out from the life\nScene description: MONITOR.\nScene description: Tank answers the call.\nMORPHEUS: Tank, find a structural drawing of\nMORPHEUS: this building and find it fast.\nScene description: The diagram windows onto the screen.\nTANK: Got it.\nMORPHEUS: I need the main wet-wall.\nScene description: Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for\nScene description: Morpheus.\nTANK: No!\nScene description: Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix when\nScene description: the PHONE RINGS.\nTANK: Operator.\nCYPHER: I need an exit!  Fast!\nTANK: Cypher?\nScene description: The PHONE RINGS.  Tank answers.\nTRINITY: Tank, it's me.\nScene description: Tank punches the exit command.\nTANK: Got him.\nScene description: Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself\nScene description: awake.\nScene description: Tank finishes loading the exit program as Cypher pulls\nScene description: back a heavy blanket, exposing a high-tech rifle.\nScene description: Suddenly, a white bolt of LIGHTNING EXPLODES against\nScene description: Tank's chair, blasting him into the air.\nScene description: Cypher checks the GUN, unable to believe he missed.\nCYPHER: Shit.\nScene description: Tank is on his feet, lunging when Cypher FIRES again,\nScene description: square into his chest.\nDOZER: No!\nScene description: The operator PHONE begins to RING.  Cypher steps over the\nScene description: SIZZLING BODY of Dozer and looks at the monitor.\nScene description: He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it\nScene description: hanging in its coma-like stillness.\nCYPHER: You know, for a long time, I\nCYPHER: thought I was in love with you,\nCYPHER: Trinity.  I used to dream about\nCYPHER: you...\nScene description: He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of\nScene description: it.\nCYPHER: You are a beautiful woman.  Too\nCYPHER: bad things had to work out like\nCYPHER: this.\nTRINITY: You killed them.\nAPOC: What?!\nSWITCH: Oh, God.\nScene description: Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the\nScene description: silent bodies.\nCYPHER: I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of\nCYPHER: this war, I'm tired of fighting.\nCYPHER: I'm tired of this ship, of being\nCYPHER: cold, of eating the same goddamn\nCYPHER: goop every day.  But most of all,\nCYPHER: I'm tired of this jagoff and all\nCYPHER: of his bullshit.\nScene description: Cypher leans over, talking to Morpheus.\nCYPHER: Surprise, asshole.  But you never\nCYPHER: saw this coming, did you?  God, I\nCYPHER: wish I could be there when they\nCYPHER: break you.  I wish I could walk\nCYPHER: in just as it happens, so right\nCYPHER: then, you'd know it was me.\nTRINITY: My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them\nTRINITY: Morpheus.\nCYPHER: He lied to us, Trinity!  He\nCYPHER: tricked us!  If he would've told\nCYPHER: us the truth, we would've told\nCYPHER: him to shove that red pill up\nCYPHER: his ass!\nTRINITY: That's not true, Cypher.  He set\nTRINITY: us free.\nCYPHER: Free?  You call this free?  All I\nCYPHER: do is what he tells me to do.  If\nCYPHER: I have to choose between that and\nCYPHER: the Matrix, I choose the Matrix.\nTRINITY: The Matrix isn't real!\nCYPHER: Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I\nCYPHER: disagree.  I think the Matrix can\nCYPHER: be more real than this world.  I\nCYPHER: mean, all I do is pull a plug\nCYPHER: here.  But there, you have to\nCYPHER: watch a man die.\nScene description: She looks up at Apoc, her face going white.\nAPOC: Trinity?\nScene description: He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and\nScene description: yanks it out.\nCYPHER: Welcome to the real world, eh\nCYPHER: baby?\nScene description: Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in\nScene description: his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then\nScene description: falls dead.\nSWITCH: No!\nTRINITY: But you're out, Cypher.  You can't\nTRINITY: go back.\nCYPHER: That's what you think.  They've\nCYPHER: promised to take me back.  They're\nCYPHER: going to reinsert my body.  I'll\nCYPHER: go back to sleep and when I wake\nCYPHER: up, I'll be fat and rich and I\nCYPHER: won't remember a goddamned thing.\nCYPHER: It's the American dream.\nScene description: He laughs, his hand sliding around the neck of Switch as\nScene description: he takes hold of her plug.\nCYPHER: By the way, if you have anything\nCYPHER: terribly important to say to\nCYPHER: Switch, I suggest you say it now.\nTRINITY: Oh no, please don't.\nScene description: Trinity eyes find Switch and she knows she's next.\nSWITCH: Not like this.  Not like this.\nScene description: She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as\nScene description: she is murdered.\nCYPHER: Yoo late.\nScene description: 89.\nTRINITY: Goddamn you, Cypher!\nCYPHER: Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just\nCYPHER: the messenger.  And right now I'm\nCYPHER: going to prove it to you.\nScene description: He stands over Neo.\nCYPHER: If Morpheus was right, then\nCYPHER: there's no way I can pull this\nCYPHER: plug, is there?\nScene description: She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear and he knows he is\nScene description: next.\nCYPHER: If Neo is the One, then in the\nCYPHER: next few seconds there has to be\nCYPHER: some kind of miracle to stop me.\nCYPHER: Right?  How can he be the One if\nCYPHER: he's dead?\nScene description: He takes hold of the cord.\nCYPHER: You never did answer me, Trinity,\nCYPHER: when I asked you before.  Did you\nCYPHER: buy Morpheus's bullshit?  Come on.\nCYPHER: You can tell me, did you?  All I\nCYPHER: want is a little yes or no.  Look\nCYPHER: into his eyes, Trinity, those big\nCYPHER: pretty eyes and tell me the truth.\nCYPHER: Yes or no.\nScene description: Trinity stares at Neo as a single word falls soundlessly\nScene description: from her lips.\nTRINITY: ... yes.\nCYPHER: No!\nScene description: Charred and bloody, Tank levels the gun.\nCYPHER: I don't believe it!\nTANK: Believe it or not, you piece of\nTANK: shit, you're still going to burn.\nScene description: He FIRES a CRACKLING BOLT of LIGHTNING that knocks Cypher\nScene description: flying backwards.\nScene description: Trinity's eyes snap open, a sense of relief surging\nScene description: through her at the sight of the ship.  As Tank unplugs\nScene description: her, she sees his charred wounds.\nTRINITY: Tank, you're hurt.\nTANK: I'll be all right.\nTRINITY: Dozer?\nScene description: Tank's face tightens and she takes him into her arms.\nScene description: Tank drapes a sheet over his dead brother.  The other\nScene description: bodies are covered.\nScene description: Neo looks at Morpheus, whose body is covered with a cold\nScene description: sweat.\nNEO: What are they doing to him?\nTANK: They're breaking into his mind.\nTANK: It's like hacking a computer.  All\nTANK: it takes is time.\nNEO: How much time?\nTANK: Depends on the mind.  But\nTANK: eventually, it will crack and his\nTANK: alpha pattern will change from\nTANK: this to this.\nScene description: 93.\nScene description: Tank punches several commands on Morpheus's personal\nScene description: unit.  The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to\nScene description: an ordered symmetrical one.\nTANK: When it does, Morpheus will tell\nTANK: them anything they want to know.\nNEO: What do they want?\nTANK: The leader of every ship is given\nTANK: the codes to Zion's mainframe\nTANK: computer.  If an Agent had those\nTANK: codes and got inside Zion's\nTANK: mainframe, they could destroy us.\nScene description: He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.\nTANK: We can't let that happen, Trinity.\nTANK: Zion is more important than me.\nTANK: Or you, or even Morpheus.\nScene description: Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and\nScene description: she kicks him.\nTRINITY: Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!\nNEO: There has to be something that we\nNEO: can do.\nTANK: There is.  We have to pull the\nTANK: plug.\nTRINITY: You're going to kill him?  Kill\nTRINITY: Morpheus?!\nTANK: Trinity, we don't have any other\nTANK: choice.\nScene description: Tank kneels beside Morpheus's body.\nScene description: Neo suddenly sees it perfectly clear, fate rushing at him\nScene description: like an oncoming train.\nTANK: Morpheus, you were more than our\nTANK: leader.  You were... a father.  We\nTANK: will miss you, always.\nScene description: Trinity can't bear to watch.  As she closes her eyes, her\nScene description: tears slip free.\nScene description: Tank closes his eyes and takes hold of the plug.\nScene description: Neo is paralyzed, his whole life is suddenly suspended by\nScene description: the finality of this moment hurling at him with the speed\nScene description: of a bullet.\nNEO: Stop!\nScene description: They both look at him.\nNEO: Goddamnit!  I don't believe this\nNEO: is happening!\nTANK: Neo, this has to be done!\nScene description: 95.\nNEO: Does it?  I don't know.  This\nNEO: can't be just coincidence.  It\nNEO: can't be!  Can it?\nTANK: What are you talking about?\nNEO: The Oracle.  She told me this\nNEO: would happen.  She told me...\nScene description: Neo stops, his stare fixed on Morpheus.\nNEO: That I would have to make a\nNEO: choice...\nTRINITY: What choice?\nScene description: He makes his choice.  Turning, he walks to his chair.\nTRINITY: What are you doing?\nNEO: I'm going in.\nTRINITY: You can't!\nNEO: I have to.\nTRINITY: Morpheus sacrificed himself so we\nTRINITY: could get you out!  There's no way\nTRINITY: you're going back in!\nNEO: Morpheus did what he did because\nNEO: he believed that I'm something I'm\nNEO: not.\nTRINITY: What?\nNEO: I'm not the One, Trinity.  The\nNEO: Oracle hit me with that, too.\nScene description: Trinity is stunned.\nScene description: 96.\nTRINITY: No, you... have to be.\nNEO: I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just\nNEO: another guy.  Morpheus is the one\nNEO: that matters.\nTRINITY: No, Neo.  That's not true.  It\nTRINITY: can't be true.\nNEO: Why?\nTRINITY: Because...\nScene description: Uncertainty swallows her words and she is unable to tell\nScene description: him what she wants to.\nTANK: Neo, this is loco.  They've got\nTANK: Morpheus in a military controlled\nTANK: building.  Even if you somehow got\nTANK: inside, those are Agents holding\nTANK: him.  Three of them!  I want\nTANK: Morpheus back, too, but what you\nTANK: are talking about is suicide.\nNEO: I know that's what it looks like,\nNEO: but it's not.  I can't logically\nNEO: explain to you why it's not.\nNEO: Morpheus believed something and he\nNEO: was ready to give his life for\nNEO: what he believed.  I understand\nNEO: that now.  That's why I have to\nNEO: go.\nTANK: Why?\nNEO: Because I believe in something.\nTRINITY: What?\nNEO: I believe I can bring him back.\nScene description: 97.\nScene description: Trinity stares at him, hovering on the edge that he just\nScene description: jumped off.  Her jaw sets and she starts climbing into\nScene description: the chair beside him.\nNEO: What are you doing?\nTRINITY: I'm coming with you.\nNEO: No you're not.\nTRINITY: No?  Let me tell you what I\nTRINITY: believe.  I believe Morpheus means\nTRINITY: more to me than he does to you.  I\nTRINITY: believe that if you are serious\nTRINITY: about saving him then you are\nTRINITY: going to need my help and since I\nTRINITY: am the ranking officer on this\nTRINITY: ship, if you don't like it then I\nTRINITY: believe that you can go to hell,\nTRINITY: because you aren't going anywhere\nTRINITY: else.\nScene description: There is nothing more to say except --\nTRINITY: Tank, load us up.\nScene description: Neo and Trinity's bodies hang motionless in their drive\nScene description: chairs as Tank hits load.\nScene description: Tank sits down beside Morpheus, whose face is ashen like\nScene description: someone near death.

      "answer": "The script suggests that humans are similar to a virus through the metaphorical depiction of the Machines, which have discovered a new form of fusion involving human beings, implying that humans are grown and farmed like crops in endless fields. Morpheus explains that the Machines liquefy the dead to feed the living, and describes a system where human bodies are used as batteries, generating bioelectricity and heat. This analogy indicates that humans, like viruses, are seen as a parasitic or invasive force within the system that exploits resources for their own survival. The person who explicitly articulates this comparison is Morpheus, as he talks about the fields of human beings grown for the Machines and how they are used as energy sources, reflecting the idea that humans are like a virus that consumes and spreads within the system.",

You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.

In exchange, he asks to be made rich, important, and to have his mind's pain alleviated, symbolized by his wish to be a power plant worker with a new identity. He explicitly states that he wants to forget everything and to be rich and important, like an actor, when he says, 'I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor.' Cypher's conversation with Agent Smith reveals his willingness to betray others, including the crew, by giving the Agents access codes to Zion in return for his personal happiness and a life of comfort.",

We MOVE INTO\nScene description: the monitor, entering the room as if the monitor was a\nScene description: window.\nScene description: At the same moment, the door opens and the Agents enter.\nScene description: Agent Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila\nScene description: envelope slaps down on the table.  The name on the file:\nScene description: \"Anderson, Thomas/nobreakspaceA.\"\nAGENT SMITH: As you can see, we've had our eye\nAGENT SMITH: on you for some time now, Mr.\nAGENT SMITH: Anderson.\nScene description: He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he\nScene description: flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at\nScene description: the file or at him.\nAGENT SMITH: It seems that you have been living\nAGENT SMITH: two lives.  In one life, you are\nAGENT SMITH: Thomas A. Anderson, program writer\nAGENT SMITH: for a respectable software\nAGENT SMITH: company.  You have a social\nAGENT SMITH: security number, you pay your\nAGENT SMITH: taxes and you help your landlady\nAGENT SMITH: carry out her garbage.\nScene description: The pages continue to turn.\nAGENT SMITH: The other life is lived in\nAGENT SMITH: computers where you go by the\nAGENT SMITH: hacker alias Neo, and are guilty\nAGENT SMITH: of virtually every computer crime\nAGENT SMITH: we have a law for.\nScene description: Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.\nAGENT SMITH: One of these lives has a future.\nAGENT SMITH: One of them does not.\nScene description: He closes the file.\nAGENT SMITH: I'm going to be as forthcoming as\nAGENT SMITH: I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are\nAGENT SMITH: here because we need your help.\nScene description: He removes his sunglasses, his eyes are an unnatural ice-\nScene description: blue.\nAGENT SMITH: We know that you have been\nAGENT SMITH: contacted by a certain individual.\nAGENT SMITH: A man who calls himself Morpheus.\nAGENT SMITH: Whatever you think you know about\nAGENT SMITH: this man is irrelevant.  The fact\nAGENT SMITH: is that he is wanted for acts of\nAGENT SMITH: terrorism in more countries than\nAGENT SMITH: any other man in the world.\nScene description: 21.\nAGENT SMITH: He is considered by many\nAGENT SMITH: authorities to be the most\nAGENT SMITH: dangerous man alive.\nScene description: He leans closer.\nAGENT SMITH: My colleagues believe that I am\nAGENT SMITH: wasting my time with you but I\nAGENT SMITH: believe you want to do the right\nAGENT SMITH: thing.  It is obvious that you are\nAGENT SMITH: an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,\nAGENT SMITH: and that you are interested in the\nAGENT SMITH: future.  That is why I believe you\nAGENT SMITH: are ready to put your past\nAGENT SMITH: mistakes behind you and get on\nAGENT SMITH: with your life.\nScene description: Neo tries to match his stare.\nAGENT SMITH: We are willing to wipe the slate\nAGENT SMITH: clean, to give you a fresh start\nAGENT SMITH: and all we are asking in return is\nAGENT SMITH: your cooperation in bringing a\nAGENT SMITH: known terrorist to justice.\nScene description: Neo nods to himself.\nNEO: Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a\nNEO: real good deal.  But I think I\nNEO: have a better one.  How about I\nNEO: just give you the finger --\nScene description: He does.\nNEO: And you give me my phone call!\nScene description: Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.\nAGENT SMITH: You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.\nNEO: You can't scare me with this\nNEO: Gestapo crap.  I know my rights.\nNEO: I want my phone call!\nScene description: Agent Smith smiles.\nScene description: 22.\nAGENT SMITH: And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what\nAGENT SMITH: good is a phone call if you are\nAGENT SMITH: unable to speak?\nScene description: The question unnerves Neo and strangely he begins to feel\nScene description: the muscles in his jaw tighten.  The standing Agents\nScene description: snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow into panic.\nScene description: Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly\nScene description: seal shut, melding into each other until all traces of\nScene description: his mouth are gone.\nScene description: Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the Agents\nScene description: restrain him, holding him in the chair.\nAGENT SMITH: You are going to help us, Mr.\nAGENT SMITH: Anderson, whether you want to or\nAGENT SMITH: not.\nScene description: Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.  From a\nScene description: case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long,\nScene description: fiber-optic wire tap.\nScene description: Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over\nScene description: his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the\nScene description: electronic device animates, becoming an organic creature\nScene description: that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.\nScene description: Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into\nScene description: Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature\nScene description: which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --\nScene description: -- before it begins to burrow, its tail thrashing as it\nScene description: worms its way inside.",

You feel it\nMORPHEUS: when you go to work, or go to\nMORPHEUS: church or pay your taxes.  It is\nMORPHEUS: the world that has been pulled\nMORPHEUS: over your eyes to blind you from\nMORPHEUS: the truth.\nNEO: What truth?\nMORPHEUS: That you are a slave, Neo.

Morpheus explains that the Machines discovered a new form of fusion where a small electrical charge can initiate a reaction in these human fields. He describes the fields as places where human beings are no longer born but grown, indicating these fields are used for harvesting human bodies for their bioelectricity and body heat, which the Machines exploit as an energy source. The fields are depicted as vast, endless, and designed for the growth and maintenance of human life in a controlled manner. The creation of these human fields is attributed to the Machines, who designed and operate them as part of the system to sustain themselves by harnessing human bioelectricity.",

DOJO\nScene description: They are standing in a very sparse Japanese-style dojo.\nMORPHEUS: This is a sparring program,\nMORPHEUS: similar to the programmed reality\nMORPHEUS: of the Matrix.  It has the same\nMORPHEUS: basic rules.  Rules like gravity.\nMORPHEUS: What you must learn is that these\nMORPHEUS: rules are no different than the\nMORPHEUS: rules of a computer system.  Some\nMORPHEUS: of them can be bent.  Others can\nMORPHEUS: be broken.  Understand?\nScene description: Neo nods as Morpheus assumes a fighting stance.\nMORPHEUS: Then hit me, if you can.\nScene description: Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until\nScene description: he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.\nScene description: It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and\nScene description: feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack,\nScene description: but each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.\nScene description: Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls\nScene description: himself at Morpheus.\nMORPHEUS: Good.  Adaptation.  Improvisation.\nMORPHEUS: But your weakness isn't your\nMORPHEUS: technique.\nScene description: Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.\nScene description: His feet and fists are everywhere, taking Neo apart.  For\nScene description: every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --\nScene description: Neo falls.\nScene description: Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits from his\nScene description: mouth, speckling the white floor of the dojo.\nMORPHEUS: How did I beat you?\nNEO: You -- You're too fast.\nMORPHEUS: Do you think my being faster,\nMORPHEUS: stronger has anything to do with\nMORPHEUS: my muscles in this place?\nScene description: Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.\nMORPHEUS: Do you believe that's air you are\nMORPHEUS: breathing now?\nScene description: Neo stands, nodding slowly.\nMORPHEUS: Again.\nScene description: Their fists fly with pneumatic speed.\nScene description: 49.\nScene description: Morpheus begins to press Neo, countering blows while\nScene description: slipping in several stinging slaps.\nMORPHEUS: Come on, Neo.  What are you\nMORPHEUS: waiting for?  You're faster than\nMORPHEUS: this.  Don't think you are.  Know\nMORPHEUS: you are.\nScene description: Whack, Morpheus cracks Neo again.  Neo's face twists with\nScene description: rage as the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo.\nMORPHEUS: Come on!  Stop trying to hit me\nMORPHEUS: and just hit me.\nScene description: Wham.  A single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the\nScene description: head, knocking off his glasses.\nScene description: Morpheus rubs his face, then smiles.\nNEO: I know what you're trying to do --\nMORPHEUS: I'm trying to free your mind, Neo,\nMORPHEUS: but all I can do is show you the\nMORPHEUS: door.  You're the one that has to\nMORPHEUS: step through.  Tank, load the jump\nMORPHEUS: program.\nScene description: 50.",
